# spinach pasta (2-3 persons)

This recipe was suggested by a friend of mine, and we are still changing it every time we make it.

## ingredients
- 1 union
- 2 pieces of garlic
- couple of table spoons of olive oil
- 400 gr canned tomato (diced)
- bit of sugar
- 30 gr fresh basil
- 30 gr pine nuts (+-2 table spoons)
- 200 gr spinach
- 250 gr cherry tomatoes
- 250 gr fresh pasta
- 250 gr ricotta

## steps
1. use the garlic (1 piece), pine nuts and fresh basil to create a fine pesto
   (see: https://uitpaulineskeuken.nl/2013/10/pesto-maken.html).
   Note: we do not add parmesan cheese to the pesto, so we don't know if it
         works with the dish.
   
2. cut the union in fine pieces and the garlic (1 piece) in fine slices.
   Saute the onion (in olive oil) for like 5 minutes after which you add the
   garlic and let that fry for like 2 minutes. Add the diced tomatoes and
   bring to the boil. Add sugar, salt and pepper to your liking (make sure
   you taste it). Put the lid on the pan and let your sauce boil for like
   30 minutes with little heat.

3. dice the cherry tomatoes in half, and together with the spinach add them
   to the sauce.

4. cook the paste al dente (+- 4 minutes) after which, together with the sauce
   it is ready to serve.
